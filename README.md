# CS3050 Rogue

## What is this
This is a recreation of the 1980's game Rogue, a randomly generated role playing game where the player had to make it to the bottom of a randomly generated dungeon without dying. This recreation is made in Python Arcade and contains many features present in the original game, alongside new visuals and controls. This is a public reupload of the original repository that was originaly a project in my software engineering class at UVM

## How to run it
You need Python and the Python Arcade library installed and then all you need to do is run main.py

## Credits
This was coded in a group of four people consisting of me (Evan Satterfield) and fellow students Max Ivry (who also did the music), Michael Piscione, and Noah Schonhorn. The sprites were drawn by Kaitlyn Jones.
